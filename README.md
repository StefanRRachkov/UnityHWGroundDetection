# UnityHWGroundDetection
You have a scene with a ground plane and a player that can move. You can use the Homework 2 Base scene from Ivan's Physics exercise.  The task is to write a script that lets the player jump. Jumping is allowed only if the player was previously on the ground (otherwise he would be able to jump to infinity).
